I am a PhD student in Economics at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), with research interests in Health Economics, Spatial Econometrics, Climate and Infectious Diseases.

My current research focuses on the effects of climate variability and extreme events on infectious diseases, with emphasis on Chikungunya, Dengue, and other climate-sensitive health outcomes. I work with large-scale spatial panel datasets, causal inference, and advanced econometric methods.

I have experience with:
- Health Economics and Epidemiology  
- Spatial Econometrics and GIS  
- Climate Data (ERA5, SPEI, SPI)  
- Panel Data Models and Causal Inference  
- Python, R, Stata, and Geospatial Analysis
